Hello and thanks for considering contributing to markdown-tweet-scheduler!

Go ahead and put in a PR and I will try to review ASAP. 

This was sort of a weekend project, that quite a few people have found beneficial. It was also one of my first Go projects, so it's not written perfectly. 

I will merge feature additions before refactors, and I will try to merge chronologically, but I also will take into account impact and features being shipped. Sorry if this causes merge conflicts on your branch!
